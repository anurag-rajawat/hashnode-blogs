## What is Kubernetes?

**Kubernetes** is a Greek word for ***pilot*** or ***helmsman*** (the person holding the ship's steering wheel). Kubernetes (also known as **K8s**) is an open-source container orchestration system. It is a software system that allows us to easily deploy and manage containerized applications. It enables us to run software applications on thousands of computer nodes as if all those nodes were a single, enormous computer. It abstracts away the underlying infrastructure and, by doing so, simplifies development, deployment, and management for both development and ops teams. It is vendor-neutral and runs on all cloud providers.

## Its origin

Google is one of only a few companies in the world that runs hundreds of thousands of servers and has had to deal with managing deployments on such a massive scale. They realized that they needed a much better way to deploy and manage their applications and infrastructure to scale globally. So they developed an internal system called Borg and later a new system called Omega, that helped both application developers and system administrators in managing thousands of applications and services at a massive scale.

After having kept Borg and Omega secret for a whole decade, in mid-2014 Google introduced Kubernetes as an open-source system based on Borg and other internal systems. In July Microsoft, RedHat, IBM, and Docker join the Kubernetes community. On July 2015 v1.0 was released. Along with the release, Google partnered with the Linux Foundation to form the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) and donated it to CNCF.

## What is the need for Kubernetes?

Let's first understand how the development and deployment of applications have changed in recent years. Years ago, most applications were monoliths, running as a single process across a handful of servers. They have slow release cycles and are updated infrequently. At the end of every release cycle, developers package up the whole system and hand it over to the ops team, who then deploys and manages it, and in case of hardware failures, the ops team manually migrates it to the healthy servers.

Today, these big monolithic applications are broken down into smaller, independent components called [microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices). These independent components are decoupled from each other, they can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually. This enables you to change components quickly and as often as necessary to keep up with todayâ€™s rapidly changing business requirements.

With the increase in the number of deployable components, it becomes difficult to configure, manage and keep the whole system running smoothly, and all this hard work was done manually. So, we need automation, which can automatically schedule those components to our servers, and automatically configure and handle failures. That's where Kubernetes comes in.

Kubernetes enables developers to deploy their applications as frequently as they want without requiring any assistance from the ops team. It not only benefits developers but also the ops team by automatically monitoring, and re-scheduling to healthy servers in case of hardware failures.

## Features of Kubernetes

* Self-healing
    
* Scaling
    
* Zero downtime deployments
    
* Secret and configuration management
    
* Automate Deploying Rollouts and Rollbacks
    
* Service discovery and load balancing
    

and a lot more

## Kubernetes Architecture

![components-of-kubernetes (1).png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1665741860925/0Irnh2ec5.png align="left")

Kubernetes is composed of a set of worker nodes and a control plane that manages worker nodes. The control plane is a node that controls and manages the whole Kubernetes system. Worker nodes are physical/virtual machines running within a data center or on-premise that run workloads. Together they form a cluster.

*The control plane was previously called the master node.*

## Control plane components

* **API Server** - The API server with which you and the other components communicate. It exposes a [REST](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api) interface and client tools like Kubernetes CLI [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) that communicate through that REST API. It saves the state in the **etcd** datastore.
    
* **etcd** - It is a reliable distributed open-source key/value datastore that persistently stores the cluster configuration. It is the single source of truth. It is not a database for the applications to use.
    
* **ControllerManager** - It is the controller of controllers. Its role is to run other controllers like Node controller, Replication controller, Endpoints controller, Service account controller, and Token controller.
    
* **Scheduler** - The Scheduler has a very crucial role in the control plane. It assigns a worker node to each deployable component of your application. There are many factors taken into account for scheduling decisions including individual and collective resource requirements, hardware/software policy constraints, data locality, etc.
    

## Worker Node Components

When a worker node is added to the Kubernetes cluster some services are automatically added to the worker node like *container runtime*, *kubelet*, and *kubeproxy* these are the necessary services to run pods and are managed by the control plane components on the control plane.

* **kubelet** - The kubelet is the primary node agent that runs on each node and manages the pod's lifecycle. It ensures that the containers described in the PodSpecs file are running and healthy.
    
* **kubeproxy** - The kuberpoxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster. Its job is to manage network configuration. It is a core networking concept of Kubernetes. All network traffic goes through kubeproxy.
    
* **Container runtime** - The container runtime is the low-level component that creates and runs containers on the host operating system. Kubernetes support several container runtimes which implement the Kubernetes container runtime interface (CRI) like docker, rkt, cri-o, etc.
    

This is the first part of the [Kubernetes Fundamental series](https://anuragr.hashnode.dev/series/kubernetes-fundamentals) where we've learned about what is Kubernetes and its components. In the next part, we'll set up a local Kubernetes cluster on our workstation and will do hands-on practice so stay tuned.

Thank you so much for taking your valuable time to read.
